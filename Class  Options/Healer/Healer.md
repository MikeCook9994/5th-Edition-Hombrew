## Feature Notes
d8 Hit-Die
Intelligence and Wisdom Saving Throw proficiency 
Skills: Medicine and 2 of Nature, Insight, Persuasion, Investigation, Perception, Survival

### Method of Practice
Presents a choice of primary ability score between Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. Medicine checks are made using that ability score and with Expertise.
### First Aid
Provides some limited healing and a reliable mechanism to stabilize creatures. Not intended to scale particularly well beyond level 3 because your subclass will provide your core healing mechanism
### Treatments 
Allows for the creation of a series of expendable items that can be used to remove various status conditions or provide buffs. Rather than spells which are purely dynamic, this will leverage a more traditional Vancian system where you explicitly create one of a handful of treatments after completing a long rest and you expend that explicitly created resource. Some treatments will have level prerequisites to prevent the healer from being able to handle some conditions far earlier than other classes. Because they are similar to potions, I believe treatments should be able to be handed out to other characters. The healer can expend them on themselves on as a bonus action; however, it will require an action to expend a treatment on another character or if a non-healer expends a treatment on themselves.
### 3rd Level Medical Specialty Feature
This provides access to the core feature that will be used to do the bulk of character's healing. At this point first-aid will be used as a fallback in the way that the spare the dying cantrip eventually gets replaced.
### 5th Level Treatments
New treatments will unlock. Of note, curse removal comes online at this point. There are also a handful of buff effects like haste or fly that could become available. Both of those examples require concentration so they would require significant modification.
### Toxins 
The antithesis to treatments. This will include things like poisons, weapon oils, etc... that can be used by the healer or their allies to harm their enemies.
### 6th Level Medical Specialty Feature
This subclass feature should generally provide a reliable mechanism for the player to heal multiple characters at once.
### Revised Treatment Plan
The current thinking is that this will enable the class to expend some number of their prepared treatments to prepare new treatments when they complete a short rest. This enables the versatility that is required for a dedicated healer class. I suspect the specific design of this feature will change substantially, as there are a handful of features that all contribute towards this versatility goal and I imagine some of them are currently penciled to come online too late.
### 9th Level Treatments
New treatments will unlock that target the new functionality made available by 5th level spells. Minimally, this includes greater restoration. This is the point where I believe supplemental treatments will become more creative.
### 10th Level Medical Specialty Feature 
There are no guidelines on this presently.
### Taste of your Own Medicine 
When you administer a treatment to a creature other than yourself, you also gain the benefits of that treatment. Also includes some splash healing. This is really important for solving the "do I heal the healer or my ally problem." The healer should have an easier time staying up because there's no one to watch them. Additionally, the healer is liable to take more damage against an intelligent enemy.
### Adaptive Remedies 
Principally, the idea here is that you can expend one of your prepared treatments to administer any treatment that you meet the prerequisites for. This is another feature that helps achieve the versatility  goal. I am concerned that this comes online too late. Though, I guess in retrospect, other healing capable classes don't have anything that explicitly helps enable this kind of dynamic versatility. If they didn't prepare a particular spell, they're out of luck. Maybe I'm thinking about versatility the wrong way....
### 14th Level Medical Specialty Feature 
There are no guidelines on this presently.
### Paragon of Health 
The initial thinking here was that you would receive some condition immunities and damage resistances, but I've realized that potentially devalues Taste of Your Own Medicine. I think saving throw advantage/bonus against a large collection of conditions would be better.
