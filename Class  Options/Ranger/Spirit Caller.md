## Call Nature Spirit
*3rd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

As a spirit caller, you . The strength of your bond to the nature spirits is represented by your Spirit dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to your proficiency bonus. These Spirit dice are used to fuel powers provided to you by nature spirits. The spirits that you can call upon are described below, and you gain access to additional spirits as you can levels in the Ranger class.

Once per turn you can call upon a spirit, and you must expend a Spirit die to do so. Additionally, each spirit's description details when the spirit can be called. You cannot call a spirit if you have no remaining Spirit dice. You regain all of your Spirit dice when you finish a long rest.
