# Otherwordly Patron

Known as Great Wyrms, the oldest dragons command cataclysmic power that carves its own place in history when its potential is realized. The oldest of these dragsons have lived for a millenium and some hundreds of years; however, a few among these ranks have subverted their own mortality by turning to lichdom or other unnatural means of preservation.

The motiviations and capabilities of dragons vary greatly depending on their lineage -- be that chromatic, gemmed, or metallic. Regardless of their lineage, many of them take great inerest in the smaller races for one reason or another. It is these interests, however selfish, that lead to a great wyrm choosing to bind itself into an eldritch pact with a mortal being.

## The Chromatic Great Wyrm

You have made a pact with one of the most devastating chromatic dragons. Chromatic dragons are almost universally evil in alighment. They peronsify vanity and greed by laying claim to all the world's wealth. They see themsleves as the most powerful of the mortal races and that they alone are fit to rule the prime material where many of them stake their claim.

Chromatic great wyrms powerful enough to bestow an eldritch pact include Tiamat, Queen of Evil Dragons; Xavarathimius, The Everlasting Wyrm; and Ashardalon.

Consider how your pact with a creature that embodies destruction and ego came to be. What is it that your patron wants that they cannot obtain by themselves?

### Draconic Effigy
*1st-level Chromatic Great Wyrm feature*

You’ve adopted some qualities of your draconic patron. You learn the Draconic language and you gain resistance to a damage type determined by your patron’s color: acid (black), lightning (blue), fire (red), poison (green), cold (ice). If you already have permanent resistance to the damage type granted by your patron’s color, you may choose a different damage type granted by a different chromatic great wyrm patron color and gain resistance to it.

### Dragon's Ire
*1st-level Chromatic Great Wyrm feature*

Once per turn, when you hit with an attack roll, you can do an additional 1d4 damage to the target. The type of this damage is determined by your patron’s color: acid (black), lightning (blue), fire (red), poison (green), cold (ice). This damage increases to 1d8 at 6th level and 2d8 at 14th level.

### Path of Ruin
*6th-level Chromatic Great Wyrm feature*

You can channel the breath weapon of your patron to lay ruin to your foes. As an action, you can exhale a torrent of harmful energy 30 feet long and 10 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the area must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 damage or half as much damage on a successful save. The type of this damage is determined by the color of your patron’s color: acid (black), lightning (blue), fire (red), poison (green), cold (ice).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Terrorize the Meek
*10th-level Chromatic Great Wyrm feature*

You can channel your patron’s frightening presence to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies. As an action, you can unleash a deafening draconic roar akin to that of the most awful dragons. Each creature of your choice that is within a 30-foot radius of you must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or become deafened and frightened of you for one minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight of you or is more than 30 feet away from you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Mortal Apex
*14th-level Chromatic Great Wyrm feature*

The force of your patron’s power courses through you so intensely that you are nearly as dragon as you are humanoid. As a bonus action, you can manifest your draconic self to gain additional abilities. You choose the changes to your form such as wings and a tail. For 1 minute or until you are unconscious, you gain the following benefits until the effect ends:

* You gain a fly speed of 60 feet.
* You have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
* You gain 60 feet of darkvision in addition to existing darkvision you have.
* You can exhale your breath weapon as a 60-foot long, 10-foot-wide line or as a 30-foot cone and the damage increases to 12d6. You may use your breath weapon once while in this form even if you have not yet completed a short or long rest since you last used it.
* You can use your action to perform a wing attack causing each creature within 5 feet of you to make a strength saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 damage plus your charisma modifier as bludgeoning damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you on a failed save or half damage and is not pushed back on a successful save.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Gem Great Wyrm

You have made a pact with one of the most illustrious gem dragons. Spending much of their time on the elemental planes, gem dragons do not litter the annals of history like chromatic and metallic dragons do. Like their chromatic relatives, gem dragons are primarily self-interested but are not subject to the same malicious streak. Gem dragons are characterized by their unique psionic capabilities that enable them to warp and control the minds of others.

Examples of gem great wyrms who may serve as a patron include Sardior, Firstborn of All Creation and Ruler of Gem Dragons; Eldenser, The Wyrm who Hides in Blades; and Amaeraszantha, Great Wyrm of the Tears.

### Draconic Effigy
*1st-level Gem Great Wyrm feature*

You’ve adopted some qualities of your draconic patron. You learn the Draconic language and you gain resistance to a damage type determined by your patron’s color: force (amethyst), radiant (crystal), psychic (emerald), thunder (sapphire), necrotic (topaz). If you already have permanent resistance to the damage type granted by your patron’s color, you may choose a different damage type granted by a different gem great wyrm patron color and gain resistance to it.

### Psionic Conference
*1st-level Gem Great Wyrm feature*

As part of your connection with your patron, you gain psionic abilities unique to them as dragons. You can speak telepathically with other creatures you are aware of within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.

### Stunning Eloquence
*6th-level Gem Great Wyrm feature*

As an action, you can exhale a glimmering cloud of gas in 20-foot cone in a direction you choose. Each creature within the area must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not stunned. The type of this damage is determined by your patron’s color: force (amethyst), radiant (crystal), psychic (emerald), thunder (sapphire), necrotic (topaz).

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Manifest Opulence
*10th-level Gem Great Wyrm feature*

As an action, you can manifest a large gem reminiscent of your patron at a point within 60 feet of you that lasts for 1 minute while you maintain concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). This gem is 5 feet wide in each dimension and floats 5 feet above the ground. All creatures other than you within 30 feet of this gem must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is charmed by you until the effect ends. A creature charmed by you in this way believes that acquiring this gem for their own wealth is their only goal. They will spend all of their movement to reach it and go as far as to attack their allies to prevent them from acquiring it for themselves.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

* You can use your action to perform a wing attack causing each creature within 5 feet of you to make a strength saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 damage plus your charisma modifier as bludgeoning damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you on a failed save or half damage and is not pushed back on a successful save.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Metallic Great Wyrm

# Pact Boon Option
*3rd-level warlock feature*

When you choose your Pact Boon feature, the following options are available to you.

## Pact of the Aegis

Your patron bestows a fragment of their mighty carapace upon you. While it is on your person, you can use a bonus action to brandish it as your pact shield; its size, shape, and appearance morphing to your fit your desire. You are proficient with it while you wield it and it is considered a magical item. Your armor class is increased by +2 while you brandish your pact shield.

Your pact shield disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the shield (no action required), or if you die.

You can bind one magical shield into the fragment by performing a special ritual while you hold the shield. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. When the ritual completes, the shield is pulled into the armor fragment in its entirety. An artifact or a sentient shield cannot be the target of this ritual. The shield ceases being your pact shield if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different shield, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The shield appears at your feet in the nearest empty space when the bond breaks.

# Eldritch Invocation Options

When you choose eldritch invocation, you have access to these additional options.

### Elemental Blast
*Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip*

When you cast eldritch blast, you can choose its damage type to be any of the following damage types: acid, fire, lightning, poison, cold.

### Eldritch Insight

You can cast *Identify* as a ritual.

### Bloodied Lashing
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade*

Landing a critical hit with a pact weapon causes the target to bleed for an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. Successful melee attacks against this creature deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage until the end of your next turn.

### Natural Killer
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade*

You can now choose to manifest your pact weapon as natural weapons of your patron such as claws and fangs that deal 1d6 slashing or piercing damage dependent on the form your natural weapons take (i.e., fangs may do piercing damage, while claws may do slashing damage). The damage die for your natural weapons increases to 1d8 at 9th level and 1d10 at 17th level.

When you perform the ritual to transform a magic weapon into your pact weapon, you can instead choose to bind the weapon to your natural weapons whose form you choose during the ritual. When the ritual completes, the weapon disappears, having been absorbed into your natural pact weapons. Your natural weapons share all of the properties and features of the weapon bound to them. The weapon reappears at your feet when the bond with it breaks.

### Eldritch Armor
*Prerequisite: 5th-level warlock, Pact of the Aegis feature*

Your patron’s gift hardens your natural defenses. While the fragment is on your person and you are not wearing armor, your armor class equals 10 + Your Dexterity Modifier + Your Charisma Modifier, representing the connection between you and the eldritch powers bestowed upon you by your patron. You choose how the natural armor manifests on you. You can brandish your pact shield while maintaining this effect.

### Hand of the Patron
*Prerequisite: 12th-level warlock, Pact of the Aegis feature*

As a bonus action, you can extend the properties of your pact shield to a creature other than yourself that you can see within 60 feet for 1 minute. They benefit from the properties of the shield as if they were wielding it and attuned to it themselves regardless of if they are proficient with shields. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). You regain expended uses when you complete a long rest. On later turns, you can use a bonus action to transfer these benefits of your pact shield to another creature you can see within 60 feet without expending an additional use.

While this effect is active, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to immediately move the benefits of your pact shield to the creature hit by the attack, including against the triggering attack.

### Improved Pact Shield
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Aegis feature*

You can use any shield you summon with your Pact of the Aegis feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the shield provides an additional +1 bonus to your AC, unless it is bound to a magical shield that already provides an equivalent or better bonus.

### Eldritch Elements
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Aegis feature*

While you brandish your pact shield, you can use its ancient eldritch power to protect you from elemental damage. You can cast Absorb Elements as a first level spell without expending a spell slot. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up). You regain expended uses after you complete a long rest.
