# `=this.file.name`

Druids of most other circles find purpose in shepparding and sheltering living beasts and creatures alike. They guide them to where they seek and provide them healing in times of need. Yet, these other druid circles also recognize the importance of preserving the natural balance. What lives must eventually die, so life can be born anew. However, there are those that pervert this cycle by toying with life before or beyond its time is up. Druids of the Circle of Nightmares carry the heavy burden of balancing the scales against these perversions. You are the darkness, for without it, light would have no purpose.

## Circle Spells
*3rd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

The harrowing nature of your circle's promise grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the `=this.file.name` Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Reaper's Mark
*3rd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You can mark a creature as a target of your hunt. You can use your bonus action to curse one creature within 60 feet of you with reaper's mark. While a creature is affected by reaper's mark, they have a -1 penalty to their Armor Class or one of their Saving Throw bonuses, which you choose when the curse is applied. The maximum number of reaper's mark curses that you can have applied at once is equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can be afflicted by multiple instances of this curse; however, the penalty to their Armor Class or one of their Saving Throw bonuses cannot exceed half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The curse lasts for one minute or until you choose to remove it (no action required).

## Nightmare Scythe
*3rd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You conjure a nightmarish weapon in the form of scythe. You can conjure and dismiss the scythe as if drawing or sheathing any other weapon. The weapon lasts until you dismiss it, you die, or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. You can use the weapon as a spellcasting focus for your Druid spells. Additionally, the weapon can be affected by the *shillelagh* cantrip, which you learn if you do not already know it. The scythe has the following traits:

**Weapon Category:** Simple Melee
**Damage on a Hit:** 1d8 Slashing
**Properties:** Two-Handed

When you cast *shillelagh* on the scythe, you can choose to expend a use of your wild shape to enhance the casting of the *shillelagh* spell. When you do so, the duration of  *shillelagh* increases to 10 minutes and it does not end if you drop the weapon. Additionally, when you hit a creature with an attack or a creature fails a saving throw forced by a spell you cast, you can deal additional damage to target equal to the number of reaper's mark curses applied to them. You choose the damage type from the following list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or psychic. Once per turn when you deal this additional damage, you can choose to first apply reaper's mark to the target. 

Additionally, you can bind your scythe to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your scythe are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is bound to your scythe. While the weapon is bound to your scythe, the weapon is absorbed into your scythe and the scythe gains its magical properties. If the weapon required attunement to benefit from its magical properties, your number of available attunement slots is reduced by 1 while the weapon is bound to the scythe.

The bond between your scythe and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The bound weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.

## Discern Weakness
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

Your curse provides insight into a target's capabilities and deficiencies. When you use your bonus action to curse a creature with reaper's mark, you can choose to learn one of the following pieces of information about the target: one of the target's saving throw bonuses (you choose which), one of the target's damage vulnerabilities, if any, or the target's damage resistances and immunities, if any.

## Extra Attack
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You can attack with your nightmare scythe twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

## Death or Torment
*10th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You can tear your curses from your enemies to attempt to deal the killing blow. Those that survive will wish they hadn't. You can use your action to remove three or more instances of reaper's mark from a single target. When you do so, the target suffers 2d8 psychic damage for each instance of reaper's mark you removed and must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice.

**Unyielding Darkness.** The target is blinded and cannot benefit from Blindsight, Darkvision, Tremorsense, or Truesight until the end of your next turn.
**Oppressive Gravity.** The target is restrained until the end of your next turn.
**Binding Reality.** The target cannot teleport by any means for one minute.
**Nature's Offensive.** The target becomes vulnerable to one damage type of your choice from the following list until the end of your next turn: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison.

## All Things Must End
*14th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

Your ire symbolizes the deliverance of death. Any attack roll you make against a creature cursed with your reaper's mark is a critical hit on a roll of a 19 or 20 on the d20. Additionally, when you score a critical hit against a creature, you can immediately use your Death or Torment feature, provided the target has at least three instances of reaper's mark applied.
