# `=this.file.name`

Flavor text

## Earthshaper Magic
*2nd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

Your connection to the earth grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the `=this.file.name` Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Earth Shaping
*2nd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You can shape the earth to your advantage. You have a number points, called earth shaping points, that you can spend to fuel your abilities as an Earthshaper. You have a number of these points equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain any expended earth shaping points after you complete a short or long rest.

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 earth shaping point to cause a pillar of dirt to erupt from an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 60 feet of you. The pillar occupies a 5 foot square and has a height of 5 feet. You can expend additional earth shaping points to increase the height of the pillar by 5 feet for each additional point you expend. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend all of your remaining earth shaping points and create any number of pillars with a combined height less than or equal five times the number of earth shaping points you expended.

A pillar has an AC equal to your Spell Save DC and hit points equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus. A pillar is destroyed when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it is not in contact with the ground, or one hour has passed since it was created. When a pillar is destroyed, you regain a number of earth shaping points equal to the pillars height divided by 5. Additionally, the pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 5 foot radius that lasts until cleared. Each 5 foot diameter portion of difficult terrain requires one minute to clear by hand.
