# `=this.file.name`

Your innate magic comes from the untamed primordial forces of the elemental planes that suffuse your soul. Some among your ranks derive their power through an ancestral connection with some elemental being such as a genie, elemental, or other primordial. Others found their power because they were near occasions of great elemental turmoil, such as a powerful tsunami or the earth-shattering eruption of a major volcano, that left them infused with the remnants of that elemental power.

## Primordial Origin
*1st-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class. At 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, choose two spells from the Elemental Spells table. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. These count as sorcerer spells for you, but they do not count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell on table of the same level. 

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | Burning Hands, Thunderwave, Earth Tremor, Ice Knife |
| 3rd | Scorching Ray, Gust of Wind, Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp, Rime’s Binding Ice |
| 5th | Fireball, Fly, Erupting Earth, Sleet Storm |
| 7th | Wall of Fire, Storm Sphere, Stone Shape, Ice Storm |
| 9th | Immolation, Steel Wind Strike, Transmute Rock, Cone of Cold |

Additionally, you can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.

## Manifest Elements
*1st-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You have learned to embody the primordial chaos that brews inside of you. As a bonus action or after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher on your turn, you can choose to manifest one of those elements. When you do so, the effects last until you manifest a different element, you fall unconscious, or you choose to stop it any time. You can choose between the following elemental manifestations:

### Fire

Your body wreathes with flames from the Elemental Plane of Fire. You have resistance to fire damage and when a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, they suffer 1d10 damage. This damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.

### Earth

Stone of the Elemental Plane of Earth binds to you. You have resistance to poison damage and your Armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity Modifier + your Charisma modifier if you are not wearing any armor.

### Water

Ribbons of soothing water from the Elemental Plane of Water swaddle you and tend to your wounds. You have resistance to cold damage and you restore a number of hit points equal to your half of your sorcerer level at the end of each of your turns if you have less than half of your maximum hit points remaining.

Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Air

Gusts from the Elemental Plane of Air envelop you. You have resistance to lightning and thunder damage and ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage against you.

## Hardened Against the Elements
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you take damage of the type you resist granted by your current elemental manifestation, you can use your reaction to spend 2 sorcery points to gain immunity to that damage type, including against the triggering damage, until the end of your next turn.

## Elemental Tempest
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

Your practice and study of the elemental power within you has enabled you to manifest the powers of more than one element at a time despite the intrinsic chaos they create when mixed. When you choose an elemental manifestation, you can choose a second elemental manifestation and maintain the effects of both manifestations simultaneously.

## Improved Manifestations
*14th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You have been able to tame the primordial forces that rage inside of your soul. Your manifestations are now improved reflecting your greater control over the power.

### Fire

You have learned to harness the fury of the Elemental Plane of Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls made with spells that will do fire damage and you may add your Charisma modifier to any fire damage you do with spells.

### Earth

You have hardened the armor gifted to you by the Elemental Plane of Earth. You have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

### Water

You have come to understand the restorative nature of the waters that encircle you and may now choose to confer the healing granted to you at the end of your turn to another creature within 30 feet of you. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of their maximum hit points.

### Air

You can now command the winds of the Elemental Plane of Air. You gain a fly speed equal to your movement speed.

## Plane Touched
*14th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You learn the *Plane Shift* spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest unless you target either the elemental plane of fire, water, earth, or air. If you do, you can satisfy the spell's material components by manifesting the plane's element while casting the spell. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

## Primordial Incarnate
*18th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You have tamed the four fundamental elemental forces within you. When you choose an elemental manifestation, you can choose to manifest all four primordial forces simultaneously. You can maintain this state for one minute, until you fall unconscious, or you choose to end it at any time. Once you have entered this state, you cannot enter it again until you complete a long rest or you spend 5 sorcery points when you choose an elemental manifestation.
