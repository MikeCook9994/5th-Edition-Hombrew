# `=this.file.name`

A street ruffian with a spark of arcane potential, you never turned down a fight even when you had the chance to. But when others chose to train their bodies, you chose to train your mind because you prefer not to get your hands dirty.

## Shadow Boxing
*2nd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You learn the Mage Hand cantrip if you do not already know it. When you cast it as a wizard spell, it behaves differently for you in the following ways:
* The spell's duration is 24 hours.
* The spell has a range of 60 feet. The hand will not vanish until it is more than 60 feet away from you or if you cast the spell again.
* You can move the hand up to 60 feet when you move it.
* The hand can carry 5 pounds for each point of your Intelligence score.
* You can use the hand as part of the action that you used to case the spell.

Additionally, you can use your mage hand to make an unarmed strike against targets within 5 feet of it. When you do so, make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target suffers 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier force damage. This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach levels 5 (2d4), 11 (3d4), and 17 (4d4).

## Hit ‘em with a Left
*2nd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you use your action to cast a spell of first level or higher, to cast mage hand, or to use your mage hand, you can use your bonus action to use your mage hand.

## And then a Right
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you cast Mage Hand, you can now choose to summon two hands. You can use both hands as part of your action.

## Loaded Gloves
*6th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you cast Mage Hand or as a bonus action when you have an active mage hand, you can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make when using your mage hand to make an unarmed strike. This bonus persists until your mage hand vanishes or you use this feature again.

When you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bonus increases by one for every two slot levels above 2nd. 

## Long Arms
*10th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can now cast it through your mage hand.

## Big Hands
*10th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You learn the Arcane Hand spell if you do not already know it. When you cast the spell, you can create two hands. As part of the casting of the spell, and on subsequent turns, you can cause one of the spell's effects with only one of the hands. 

## Got ‘em by the Collar
*14th-level `=this.file.name` feature*

When you use a mage hand to make an unarmed strike, it can attempt to grapple the target if it is a large or smaller creature. When your mage hand makes a grapple check, you may roll an Intelligence (Arcana) check in place of a Strength (Athletics) check. Creatures grappled by your mage hand have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws from spells you cast and you have advantage on attack rolls against them. While your mage hand is grappling a creature, you can only use it to release the grapple.
