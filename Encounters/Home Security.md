# Home Security

This encounter can easily be dropped into any setting where a room filled with weapons and armor would make sense, such as a dungeon, keep, or even a magical item shop. Designed for 5th level characters, this encounter challenges the party to stop the onslaught of **Animated Armors** and **Flying Swords** by disabling the alarm system that activated them.

## Inside the Armory

While the exact aesthetic details of enchanted armory are for you to determine based on the chosen setting, reading the following aloud to the players as they enter the room will provide the most important details: 

> As you step inside, you stand in a large room where weapons of all types line the walls to your left and right and suits of armor are positioned around the room. An opulent weapon rack clad is filagree and honorific plagues decorates the middle of the room, though there are no weapons on it. Scanning the room, you see no other entrances nor exits.

## The Armory's Defense System

To protect against thieves, the armory has been outfitted with defenses that will automatically trigger within one minute of entering the room if it is not disabled. Players who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice the following as they scan the room:

> At the foot of the weapon rack, you notice ten small flames in a line. The farthest left flame flashes deep red six times before extinguishing. The flame to its right now begins to flicker. 

Additionally, players who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence check identify that the left-most flame flashes deep red once every second and extinguishes after 6 seconds. At this rate, all ten flames will extinguish after a total of one minute.
Investigating the weapon rack closely, there are shelves for 3 weapons on it. Under each shelf, a golden plaque is inscribed. From top to bottom the plagues read as follows:

*Second, Feirum Deadtide’s Diamond Pommeled Longsword*

*Third, Aurok Skyleaper’s Obsidian Greataxe*

*First, Virhim Whisperleaf’s  Quarterstaff*

### The Defenses

The defenses activate once all ten flames at the base of the weapon rack have extinguished themselves. At this moment the door will slam shut and lock and 3 *Flying Swords* and 2 *Animated Armors* spring to life and roll initiative.

On initiative count 20, if any creature was slain in the previous round, an identical creature will animate to replace it and roll initiative. Available defenses will continue to animate until a total of 4 *Animated Armors* and 8 *Flying Swords* have been slain or the security system is disabled.

### Disabling the Defenses

Each plaque on the weapon rack describes the appearance of a weapon and its correct position on the display. The defenses disable when the top-most shelf contains Virhim Whisperleaf’s quarterstaff, the middle shelf contains Feirum Deadtide’s longsword, and the bottom-most shelf contains Aurok Skyleaper’s Greataxe.

Players can make a Wisdom (Perception) to scan to the walls of the room for one of the weapon’s described by a plaque. 

## In the Wake of Combat

Once the animated objects have been slain or the defenses disabled, the door will unlock allowing the party to leave.
