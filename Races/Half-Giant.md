# Half-Giant

To the smaller races, half-giants are towering and mighty individuals who are no different than giants. However, to full giants, half-giants are runts that have no claim to even the lowest rung of the ladder in the ordning. Too big for one home, too small for another, and not numerous enough to start societies of their own, half-giants are often ostracized wanderers. Thanks to their giant blood, half-giants are hardy folk that find adapting and fighting to survive to be an instinctual part of who they are.

A typical half-giant will stand between 9 to 13 feet tall and weigh between 300 to 600 pounds. The lifespan of a half-giant will typically be around half that of their full giant brethren.
