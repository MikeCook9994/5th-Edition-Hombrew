# Reclaimed Tiefling

At your birth a goodly deity elected you pluck you from the swatch and reclaim you and your descendants from the ties that bound your ancestors to their infernal legacy as Tieflings. To fill the void created in the absence of your hellish lineage, that deity instilled a part of their power within you that they cannot reclaim. Through their bestowed power, you are aware of which deity chose to reclaim your line, though their intentions remain a mystery you. Like your Tiefling cousins, you maintain your free will and the choice to act as an agent of the deity’s divine portfolio or to betray what they consider an act of divine mercy is up to you.

Gold to olive skin tones. May feature a unicorn horn. No tail. Standard eye colors. Varied hair colors. Live for up to a century. Typically stand 5’6-6’4” in height and weigh 140-300 pounds.
