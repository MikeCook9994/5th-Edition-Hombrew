# Reclaimed Tiefling

At your birth a goodly deity elected you pluck you from the swatch and reclaim you and your descendants from the ties that bound your ancestors to their infernal legacy as Tieflings. To fill the void created in the absence of your hellish lineage, that deity instilled a part of their power within you that they cannot reclaim. Through their bestowed power, you are aware of which deity chose to reclaim your line, though their intentions remain a mystery you. Like your Tiefling cousins, you maintain your free will and the choice to act as an agent of the deity’s divine portfolio or to betray what they consider an act of divine mercy is up to you.

Gold to olive skin tones. May feature a unicorn horn. No tail. Standard eye colors. Varied hair colors. Live for up to a century. Typically stand 5’6-6’4” in height and weigh 140-300 pounds.

#### Lawful

When a creature within 60 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to force the creature to first roll a d20. If the result of the roll is greater than 10, the creature has advantage on their next roll. If the result of the roll is less than 10, the creature has disadvantage on their next roll. If the creature rolls a 10, you choose whether they have advantage or disadvantage on the next roll.

#### Chaotic

After a creature within 60 feet of you rolls a d20 to make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to force the creature to roll a second d20. Then, flip a coin. On a heads, they use the first roll, on tails, they use the second roll. Once within the next minute, when you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can choose to replace the result of your roll with the result of the roll that was not previously selected. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you complete a long rest.
