# Two-Headed Giant

## Two-Headed Giant Traits

**Creature Type.** You are a humanoid.

**Size.** Your size is large. 

**Speed.** Your walking speed is 40 feet.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life in the mountains and hunting before sunrise and after sunset, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Individual Intellect.** two-headed giants are fundamentally conjoined twins

two intellectually distinct individuals in one body. Because of this, each head possesses its own charisma, intelligence and wisdom scores. Skill checks and saving throws made using charisma, intelligence, or wisdom must be performed by one specific individual of the giant pair using their own ability modifier required by the skill check or saving throw. Effects that cause blindness, charm, and fright effect the giant-heads as individuals (and require individual saving throws if both are targeted).

**A United Constitution.** Both individuals share hit points and physical conditions. Conditions affecting the body including being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious effect both individuals even if the condition is caused as a result of failing a wisdom, intelligence, or charisma saving throw that targeted one of the individuals. (e.g., an individual fails the saving throw of a command spell and is commanded to “halt”). Exhaustion is shared between giant-head individuals.

**Big Hands.** You can attack with a weapon with the *two-handed* property while holding it in only one hand. When attacking with a weapon with the *versatile* property, you can only wield it with one hand; however, you roll damage for the weapon as if you were wielding it with two hands. Attacks you make with weapons that have the *light* property are made at disadvantage.

**Talking to myself.** The individuals of a two-headed giant telepathically communicate with eachother without restriction.

**Muscle memory.** Half proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws if something...

# Optional Rules for Large Player Characters

## Weapons

### Weapon Properties

Some of the standard weapon properties behave differently for large player character races:

* Melee Two-Handed weapons do not need to be wielded with two hands. Additionally, they gain the Versatile property and deal one additional die of damage when attacking with them while wielding them with two hands.
* Attacks made with Light weapons are made at disadvantage
* An attack with a Versatile weapon can only be made while wielding the weapon with one hand; however, you roll damage using the weapon's larger damage die.

There is also an additional weapon property:

**Giant.** Medium sized creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made with Giant weapons. Small and Tiny creatures cannot make attacks with giant weapons. A Large sized creature uses the Two-Handed, Light, and Versatile properties as if they were a Medium creature when attacking with a Giant weapon.
