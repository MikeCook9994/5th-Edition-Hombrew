# Two-Headed Giant

## Two-Headed Giant Traits

**Creature Type.** You are a humanoid.

**Size.** Your size is large. 

**Speed.** Your walking speed is 40 feet.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Individual Intellect.** two-headed giants are fundamentally conjoined twins

two intellectually distinct individuals in one body. Because of this, each head possesses its own charisma, intelligence and wisdom scores. Skill checks and saving throws made using charisma, intelligence, or wisdom must be performed by one specific individual of the giant pair using their own ability modifier required by the skill check or saving throw. Effects that cause blindness, charm, and fright effect the giant-heads as individuals (and require individual saving throws if both are targeted).

**A United Constitution.** Both individuals share hit points and physical conditions. Conditions affecting the body including being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious effect both individuals even if the condition is caused as a result of failing a wisdom, intelligence, or charisma saving throw that targeted one of the individuals. (e.g., an individual fails the saving throw of a command spell and is commanded to “halt”). Exhaustion is shared between giant-head individuals.

**Talking to myself.** The individuals of a two-headed giant telepathically communicate with eachother without restriction.

**Muscle memory.** Half proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws if something...

**Giant Ancestry.**

# Optional Rules for Large Characters

## Weapons

### Weapon Properties

Weapons forged to be used by large characters may be found with an additional weapon property:

**Giant.** Medium sized creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made with Giant weapons. Small and Tiny creatures cannot make attacks with giant weapons.

Some of the standard weapon properties behave differently for a Large character. These changes do not apply if the weapon has the Giant property.

**Light.** Large sized creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with light weapons. A light weapon is too small to be wielded effectively by large creatures.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. When the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage.

**Versatile.** This weapon can only be used with one hand. When you roll damage for attacks with this weapon, use the damage die specified in parantheses with this property.
