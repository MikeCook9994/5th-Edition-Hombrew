# Two-Headed Ogre

Two-headed ogres are exactly that – ogres born with two heads. Within ogre culture it is believed to be a blood curse passed down through many generations. The goodly races believe it to be simply a birth defect. Whatever the cause may be, two-headed ogres find themselves two ogres in one body. Each head has a distinct personality, intellect, and whatever else constitutes one’s definition of self. As such, one head may or may not be the best friend of the other head. But rapport aside, they share a body and it’s in the best interest of both of them to reasonably appease the other such that they take care of themselves.

## Kinship Among the Exiled

While inherently less social as a race, two-headed ogres are commonly ostracized from their gangs at a young age and left seeking companionship with those with a likeness to them. From these exiles,
communities of two headed ogres are born that are more akin to tribes of goliaths, orcs, and goblins.

## Two heads are better than one?

Two-headed ogres do not suffer from the insufferable and legendary stupidity of common ogres. Without an innate intellectual disadvantage and more deeply intertwined communities, two-headed ogres can reach intellectual capabilities of even the wisest and most intelligent of the common goodly races.

## Mild Monsters

While far more docile than their one-headed brothers, the goodly races often see two-headed ogres as simply ogres with two-heads which makes them appear even more monstrous to those not aware of
their far more reasonable temperament. They are often attacked on sight without recompence despite their interest in offering trade with travelers they come across. This has ultimately prevented two-
headed ogres from expanding beyond simple tribal life through interaction with the more common civilian races.

## Two-Headed Ogre Names

Culturally, ogres derive their names from giants where their blood originates from. As they are intellectually distinct individuals, two-headed giants often named individually. When referring to the collective they are simply hyphenated, with the name of the left individual appearing first. Because they are exiled, most two-headed ogres will pick their owns names as they reach adolescence. Two-Head ogres rarely carry familial or last names.

## Two-Headed Ogre Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your strength score increases by 2, and your constitution score increases by 2.

**Age.** Ogres age proportionally two humans. Most ogres live for around two centuries but the oldest among them may live up to 300 years of age.

**Alignment.** Unlike their one-headed brethren, two-headed ogres occupy all varieties of the alignment scale; however, they typically cater more towards true neutral in their interest of their own self-
preservation given their relationships with other races.

**Size.** Two-Headed ogres typically stand 9-10 feet tall and weight anywhere from 600 to nearly 1000 pounds. Your size is large.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant. While many have studied other languages out of tomes, proper fluency in other languages is rare amongst ogres regardless of how many head they have.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life in the mountains and hunting before sunrise and after sunset, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
gray.

**Individual Intellect.** Two-Headed Ogres are two intellectually unique individuals in one body. Because of this, each head possesses its own charisma, intelligence and wisdom scores. Skill checks and saving throws made using charisma, intelligence, or wisdom must be performed by one specific individual of the ogre pair using their own ability modifier required by the skill check or saving throw. Effects that cause blindness, charm, and fright effect the ogre-heads as individuals (and require individual saving
throws if both are targeted).

Two-headed ogres gain and take class levels individually including proficiencies and hit points. Each individual of the pair can independently perform one action and bonus action on their turn and each individual has their own reaction to use once per round.

**A United Constitution.** Both individuals share hit points and physical conditions. Conditions affecting the body including being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious effect both individuals even if the condition is caused as a result of failing a wisdom, intelligence, or charisma saving throw that targeted one of the individuals. (e.g., an individual fails the saving throw of a command spell and is commanded to “halt”). Exhaustion is shared between ogre-head
individuals.

**Undivided Intention.** One individual can perform the help action as a bonus action to aid the other individual of the pair. An individual cannot use a bonus action to help their own action.

**Takes two to tango.** As an optional rule, a two-headed ogre can be played by two distinct players, such that one player controls each of the individuals of the ogre pair. One player can contest the use of movement, spells requiring somatic components, or weapon attacks with any weapon containing the two-handed property or a versatile weapon wielded with two-hands. When an action, bonus action, or movement is contested, players roll a contested wisdom check using the ability score of the ogre they are in control of. The winner of the contested roll decides how the contested action or movement will be used. Each individual can call at most one contest per round.
