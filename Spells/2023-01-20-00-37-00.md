# Chrysalis

*5th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time.** 1 action

**Range.** 60 feet

**Components.** V, S, M (the spent chrysalis from a butterfly)

**Duration.** Instantaneous

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. The target becomes swathed in a protective shell made of organic material such as bark, webbing, etc... and gains temporary hit points equal to 5d8 + 5 times your spellcasting modifier. The shell is destroyed if all of the target's temporary hits points provided by this spell are lost. While this shell persists, the target is incapacitated and grappled and has total cover.

At the end of your next turn, the target is birthed from the chrysalis. The target gains hit points equal to the number of remaining temporary hit points remaining that were granted by this spell. Additionally, the target benefits from the following effects:
* The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 minute.
* 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level of higher, the target gains additional temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier for each slot level above 5th.
