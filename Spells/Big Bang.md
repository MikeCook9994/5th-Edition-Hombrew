## Big Bang

*10th-level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (A Sphere of Annihilation that you have controlled within the last minute)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Until this spell ends, all creatures and objects that are not currently being worn or carried within 300 feet of the Sphere of Annihilation used as the material component for this spell's casting are pulled towards it.

A creature within 300 feet of the Sphere of Annihilation must make a Strength saving throw. The spell's caster automatically succeeds against this saving throw. On a successful save, the target automatically succeeds on Strength saves forced by this spell for the remainder of the spell's duration.

On a failed save, the target is immediately pulled towards the Sphere of Annilhilation's space, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible and is restrained. Additionally, the target and all other creatures under the restrained condition caused by this spell take 1d10 bludgeoning damage. The target can make a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the restrained condition on itself caused by this spell on a success.

When this spell ends, all objects and creatures still under the effects of the restrained condition caused this spell are expelled outwards in a fiery explosion that burns with the heat of the stars. All creatures other than the caster within 300 feet of the Sphere of Annihilation suffer 20d10 fire damage and are pushed up to 300 feet away from the Sphere of Annihilation.

The normal effects of the Sphere of Annilihation used as the material component for this spell are negated for the duration of this spell
