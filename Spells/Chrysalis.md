Choose a living creature that has 0 hit points and that you can see within range. The target becomes swathed in a protective chrysalis that has hit points equal to 5d8 + 5 times your spellcasting modifier. When the target would take damage, the chrysalis takes the damage instead. The chrysalis is destroyed when it has 0 hit points. While the chrysalis persists, the target has three-quarters cover and is not prone; however, they are incapacitated and grappled. 

If the chrysalis remains at the beginning of your next turn, the target regains hit points equal to the remaining hit points of the chrysalis and the chrysalis is destroyed. Additionally, spectral wings manifest on the targetâ€™s back granting them a fly speed of 30 feet for 1 minute.
