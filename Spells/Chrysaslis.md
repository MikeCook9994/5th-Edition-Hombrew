*5th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time.** 1 action

**Range.** 60 feet

**Components.** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)

**Duration.** Instantaneous

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. The target becomes swathed in a protective shell. They gain temporary hit points equal to 5d8 + 5 times your spellcasting modifier and become stable if they are at 0 hit points. While the target has any temporary hit points granted by this spell, they are incapacitated, grappled, and have total cover.

At the start of your next turn, the target loses all remaining temporary hit points that were granted from this spell and regains hit points equal to the same number. If the target gains at least one hit point from this effect, a pair of spectral wings manifest from their back granting them a fly speed of 60 feet and half cover for 1 minute.
