## Urgent Plea

*3rd-level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see taking damage.

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a brief prayer, and the creature that was damaged is instantly swaddled in radiant light. The creature regains hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Until the end of the creature's next turn, they shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and attacks against them have disadvantage. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3rd.
