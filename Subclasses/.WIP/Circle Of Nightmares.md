Druids of most other circles find purpose in shepparding and sheltering living beasts and creatures alike. They guide them to where they seek and provide them healing in times of need. These other druid circles also recognize the importance in preserving the natural balance. What must live must eventually die, so life can be born anew. However, there are those that pervert this cycle by seeking to preserve life when it is time for it to pass or by taking life before it is its time to end. Druids of the Circle of Nightmares carry the heavy burden of balancing the scales against these perversions. You are the darkness, for without it, there would be nothing for the light to illuminate.

## Circle Spells
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

The harrowing nature of your circle's promise grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Nightmares Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Nightmare's Torment
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You exploit the interconnectedness of all natural things to wound not just the bodies of your enemies, but their psyches as well. Your natural capability to languish your foes with nightmarish torments is represented by your Torment Dice, each of which are a d4. You have a number of these dice equal to two times your proficiency Bonus.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature, you can roll a d4 to roll on the torment table without expending a Torment Die. Additionally, you can choose to expend a Torment Die to subject the target to additional or more severe torments. When you expend Torment Dice, you can treat each die as an individual roll on the Torment table or you can add the results of the die rolls in any permutation, to roll more severe torments on the Torment Table. You regain all of your Torment Dice when you finish a long rest.

The number of Torment Dice you can expend simultaneously increases to 2 at 9th level and to 3 at 17th level.

**Torment Table**

| Torment Die Result | Torment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The target suffers additional damage of a type of your choice equal to one roll of your torment die. The chosen damage type cannot be psychic, radiant, or force damage. |
| 2 | The target suffers a penalty to their next attack roll equal to one roll of your torment die. |
| 3 |  |
| 4 | The target's movement speed is reduced by a number equal to 5 times one roll of your torment die, up to half of the target's movement speed. |
| 5 | The target's armor class is reduced by 2 until the the end of your next turn. |
| 6 | Roll on the torment table twice using a d4 and a d6. Treat a roll of a 6 as a 1. The target suffers both torments. |
| 7 |  |
| 8 |  |
| 9 |  |
| 10 |  |
| 11 | The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target must use their reaction to attack their closest ally, moving up to their movement speed if necessary. If there is no ally within range, the target makes one attack against themself. |
| 12 | Roll on the torment table three times using a d4, d6, and d8. Treat a roll of a 6 as a 1. The target suffers all three torments. |

## Reaper's Scythe
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You can use your bonus action to conjure a nightmarish weapon in the form of scythe. The conjured weapons disappears until you dismiss it as a bonus action, you die, or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. The weapon has the statistics of a glaive and is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

When you conjure the scythe, or as a bonus action after it has been conjured, you can expend a use of your wild shape to empower your scythe. The scythe's empowerment lasts for 10 minutes. While your scythe is empowered and you roll a critical hit with a melee attack using the weapon or with a spell that uses it as a spellcasting focus, you can roll on the Torment table using the maximum number of allowed Torment Dice without expending them.

Additionally, can bind your scythe to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your scythe are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is bound to your scythe. While the weapon is bound to your scythe, the weapon is absorbed into your scythe and the scythe gains its magical properties. 

The bond between your sycthe and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The bound weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.
