# Pact Boon Option

## Pact of the Colonel

Your patron bestows upon you a weapon, known as your pact weapon, as a symbol of leadership in times of piece and as a tool of defense in times of war. This weapon has the statistics of a quarterstaff and appears non-threatening such as a walking stick or cane. It otherwise has an appearance of your choice. You, and only you, are proficient with the weapon. Your pact weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You accrue favor from your patron at the discretion of your Dungeon Master. Favor is generally earned when you act in the interest of your patron beyond the scope of your initial pact. Favor can be exchanged with your patron to empower your pact weapon with additional properties called pact boon enhancements. Some pact boon enhancements may have multiple ranks that enable you spend additional favor to be granted a more powerful version of the enhancement. Your pact boon enhancements are described at the end of this article. Favor cannot be refunded after it has been exchanged for a pact boon enhancement.

If a Pact Boon Enhancement has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
