# Circle of Nightmares

Druids of most other circles find purpose in shepparding and sheltering living beasts and creatures alike. They guide them to where they seek and provide them healing in times of need. These other druid circles also recognize the importance in preserving the natural balance. What must live must eventually die, so life can be born anew. However, there are those that pervert this cycle by seeking to preserve life when it is time for it to pass or by taking life before it is its time to end. Druids of the Circle of Nightmares carry the heavy burden of balancing the scales against these perversions. You are the darkness, for without it, there would be nothing for the light to illuminate.

## Circle Spells
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

The harrowing nature of your circle's promise grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Nightmares Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Nightmare's Torment
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You can exploit the interconnectedness of all natural things to wound not just the bodies of your enemies, but their psyches as well. Your natural capability to languish your foes with nightmarish torments is represented by your Torment Dice, each of which are a d4. You have a number of these dice equal to two times your proficiency Bonus. Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or a creature fails a saving throw forced by a spell you cast, you can choose to expend a torment die to roll on the Torment Table below and subject the target to the resulting effect.

The maxinum number of torment dice you can expend at once increases by 1 when you reach levels 6 (2 dice), 10 (3 dice), and 14 (4 dice) in the druid class. When you roll multiple torment dice, you can choose to group the torment die rolls in any combination. You then sum the results of the torment die rolls in each group to determine the torment for that group according to the Torment table. Any torment die rolls that are not not grouped with another roll are treated as an individual roll on the Torment table. Treat any group with a sum greater than 12 as a 12. 

You regain all of your expended torment dice when you finish a long rest.

## Sheppard of Nightmares
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or force a creature to make a saving throw, you can roll a d4 

You can use your bonus action to conjure a nightmarish weapon in the form of scythe. The conjured weapons disappears until you dismiss it as a bonus action, you die, or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. The weapon has the statistics of a glaive and is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

When you conjure the scythe, or as a bonus action after it has been conjured, you can expend a use of your wild shape to empower your scythe. The scythe's empowerment lasts for 10 minutes.

Additionally, you can bind your scythe to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your scythe are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is bound to your scythe. While the weapon is bound to your scythe, the weapon is absorbed into your scythe and the scythe gains its magical properties. 

The bond between your sycthe and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The bound weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.
