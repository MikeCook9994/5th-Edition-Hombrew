# Circle of Balance

## Circle Spells

*2nd-level Circle of Balance Feature*

The cycle of life and death is intrinsic to the balance of all things. Your understanding of these base natural forces grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels of this class, as shown on the Circle of Balance Spell Tables.
