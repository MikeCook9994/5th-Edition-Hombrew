# Osteomancy

You rely on your understanding of the energies that suffuse common objects connected to the threads that compose the infinite everything that is the Tapestry. Your awareness of awaiting fates helps you navigate the complexities of the immediate reality. When you cast spells, you apply the information bestowed to you by your osteomancy set to help manifest the outcomes they described.

## Osteomancer's Foci
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

You have an osteomancy set that is composed of objects connected to you or the natural world. Examples of suitable items are animal bones, seashells, or a small trinket from a late ancestor. The maximum number of items you can have in your osteomancy set at any time is equal to your Thaumaturge Level + your Intelligence modifier. Your Osteomancy set can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Thaumaturge spells.

You can add an item to your osteomancy set by performing a ritual lasting 10 minutes that opens your mind to how the item is connected to the Tapestry. When you complete this ritual, choose a meaning to assign to it. Meanings are detailed in the "Osteomancy Item Meaning Effects" section at the end of this subclass. You may conduct this ritual on an item already in your osteomancy set to choose a new meaning for it. You may remove an item from your osteomancy set at any time. Maintain a record of all of the items in your osteomancy set with the meanings you chose for them.

## Bone Casting Spellcraft
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

You can cast the bones in your osteomancy set to divine information about the future. When you complete a long rest, roll the casting die associated with the previously chosen meaning of each item in your osteomancy set and record the result of the roll alongside the records of your osteomancy set items and their meanings. A small illusory visage of each item in your osteomancy set appears around you representing the reading you have discerned from that item. If any visages remain when you use this feature, they are lost.

When you cast a thaumaturge spell using a spell slot, you can expend one of your readings to apply its effect as described in the "Osteomancy Item Meaning Effects" section at the end of this subclass. Once this is done, the illusory visage of the osteomancy set item that provided the reading fades.

>These rules are written to assume that you own no more than a singular die of each side count (d4, d6, d12, etc...). However, with a sufficiently large dice collection, you may choose a specific die in your collection to persistently be used as the Casting Die for a particular item in your character's osteomancy set. The chosen die must match the Casting Die associated with the item's chosen meaning according to the "Osteomancy Set Item Meanings" table and be visually distinct from all other dice that have been chosen as persistent Casting Dice.\
>\
>If you choose to do this, it is important to amend your osteomancy set record for each item to include include a sufficient visual description of the persistent Casting Die. Whenever you use your Casting the Bones feature, you can roll all of the persistent Casting Dice at once, then record the result of each casting die roll with the item it represents.
