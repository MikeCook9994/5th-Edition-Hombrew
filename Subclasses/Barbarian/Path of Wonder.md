# Path of Wonder

## Wondrous Vitality

*3rd-Level Path of Wonder Feature*

Your intrinsic bond with the weave has given you the ability to exchange a fraction of your life essence to manifest arcane effects into the world.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

You expend your own vitality to cast your barbarian spells. You can spend one of your barbarian hit dice to create a spell slot of 1st level. When you do so, roll the hit die, then take force damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the value rolled. This damage ignores temporary hit points. You can cast spells and concentrate on them while you are raging.

As you gain levels in this class, you can expend additional barbarian hit dice to increase the level of the spell slot you create by one per additional hit die you expend. The number of hit dice you can expend to create a spell slot increases by one when you reach levels 7, 13, and 19 in the barbarian class.

You prepare a number of barbarian spells that are available to you to cast, choosing from the sorcerer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of barbarian spells equal to your Constitution modifier + one third of your barabarian level, rounded up (minimum of one spell). The spell's level must not be higher than the maximum spell slot level you can create.

For example, if you are a 8th level path of wonder barbarian, you can expend up to 2 hit dice to create a spell slot. If you have a constituation of 16, your list of prepared spells can include up to 6 spells spells of 1st-level or 2nd-level in any combination. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

When you finish a long rest, you lose any spell slots you have created and you can change your list of prepared spells.

### Spellcasting Ability

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your barbarian spells, as your spells are less the result of casting a spell and more of a wondrous manifestation of your body. You use Constitution whenever a barbarian spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Consitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a barbarian spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

### Ritual Casting

You cannot ritually cast your barbarian spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

Your own body can count as a spellcasting focus for your barbarian spells.
