# Path of Wonder

## Wonderous Vitality

*3rd-Level Path of Wonder Feature*

Your intrinsic bond with the weave has given you the ability to exchange a fraction of your life essence to manifest arcane effects into the world.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

You expend your own vitality to cast your barbarian spells. To cast one of these spells, you can spend one of your hit dice to cast a spell of first level. When you do so, roll the hit die and take force damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the value rolled. This damage ignores temporary hit points. You can cast spells in this way and concentrate on them while you are raging.

As you gain levels in this class, you can expend additional hit dice to increase the level of the spell you cast by one per hit die you expend. The number of hit dice you can expend when casting a spell increases by one at levels 7, 13, and 19. 

You prepare a number of barbarian spells that are available to you to cast, choosing from the sorcerer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of barbarian spells equal to your Constitution modifier + one third of your barabarian level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spell's level must not be higher than the maximum number of hit dice you can expend to cast a spell.

For example, if you are a 8th level path of wonder barbarian, you can expend up to 2 hit dice to cast a spell. If you have a constituation of 16, your list of prepared spells can include up to spells spells of 1st-level or 2nd-level in any combination. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

### Spellcasting Ability

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your barbarian spells, as your spells are less the result of casting a spell and more a wonderous manifestation of your body's needs and wants. You use Constitution whenever a barbarian spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Consitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a barbarian spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
