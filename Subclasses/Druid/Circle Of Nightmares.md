# Circle of Nightmares

Druids of most other circles find purpose in shepparding and sheltering living beasts and creatures alike. They guide them to where they seek and provide them healing in times of need. These other druid circles also recognize the importance in preserving the natural balance. What must live must eventually die so life can be born anew. However, there are those that seek to pervert this cycle by seeking to preserve life when it is time for it to pass. Druids of the Circle of Nightmares carry the heavy burden of balancing the scales once against this perversion. You are the darkness, for without it, there would be nothing for the light to illuminate.

## Cirlce Spells
*2nd-level Circh of Nightmares Feature*

The harrowing nature of your circle's promise grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Nightmares Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Weeping Nightmare
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

The wounds you leave your enemies with scar not just their bodies but their psyches. Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature, you can choose to roll your torment die, a d4, to determine which nightmare from the Torment Table below will haunt their mind. You describe how the torment manifests in the mind of the creature when you select the torment. If you roll a critical hit against the target, you may roll your torment die twice and choose which torment to use from the die rolls. If both of the torment dies are the same, you may choose any torment which you could possibly roll with your current torment die. For example, if you current torment die is a d6, you may not choose a torment from the table with where the value in the torment die result column is greater than 6.

Your torment die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and a d12 at 17th level.

## Reaper's Scythe
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You can use your bonus action to expend a use of your wild shape to conjure a nightmarish scythe. The conjured weapon persists for a number of hours equal to half of your druid level (rounded down). The weapon disappears if you die or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. The weapon has the following properties.

* You can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls of melee weapon attacks made with the weapon.
* It's damage die is a d10 and it has the Reach and Two-Handed properties.
* It is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
* It can be used as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

Additionally, can bind your scythe to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your scythe are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is consumed by your scythe and it now gains all of its magical properties. You can choose to attune to the weapon when this ritual completes if you are not already attuned; however, you must be attuned to the weapon to benefit from any of the weapon's magical properties that require attunement.

The bond between your sycthe and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, unattune from the original weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.
