# Circle of Nightmares

Druids of most other circles find purpose in shepparding and sheltering living beasts and creatures alike. They guide them to where they seek and provide them healing in times of need. These other druid circles also recognize the importance in preserving the natural balance. What must live must eventually die, so life can be born anew. However, there are those that pervert this cycle by seeking to preserve life when it is time for it to pass or by taking life before it is its time to end. Druids of the Circle of Nightmares carry the heavy burden of balancing the scales against these perversions. You are the darkness, for without it, there would be nothing for the light to illuminate.

## Circle Spells
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

The harrowing nature of your circle's promise grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Nightmares Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Reaper's Mark
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You can exploit the interconnectedness of all natural things to wound not just the bodies of your enemies, but their psyches as well. Once on your turn you can mark a creature when you attack it or force it to make a saving throw. 

When you mark a creature

## Reaper of Nightmares
*2nd-level Circle of Nightmares Feature*

You conjure a nightmarish weapon in the form of scythe. You can conjure and dismiss the scythe as if drawing or sheathing any other weapon. The weapon lasts until you dismiss it, you die, or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. The weapon counts quarterstaff; however, it deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning. Additionally, it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

You can expend a use of your wild shape to empower your scythe after it has been conjured. The scythe's empowerment lasts for 10 minutes. While the scythe is empowered, once per turn, you can roll on the Torment table without expending one of your available torment dice. You can choose to spend additional torment dice when you use this feature.

Additionally, you can bind your scythe to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your scythe are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is bound to your scythe. While the weapon is bound to your scythe, the weapon is absorbed into your scythe and the scythe gains its magical properties. If the weapon required attunement to benefit from its magical properties, your number of available attunement slots is reduced by 1 while the weapon is bound to the scythe.

The bond between your sycthe and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The bound weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.
