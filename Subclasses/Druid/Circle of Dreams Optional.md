# Circle of Dreams Optional Features

This section offers additional features that you gain as a circle of dreams druid. 

## Circle Spells
*2nd-level Circle of Dreams Feature*

Your circle grants you access to some spells to help you better guide the those you sheppard, as shown on the Circle of Dreams Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## Sheppard of Dreams
*2nd-level Circle of Dreams Feature*

You conjure a dremy weapon in the form of a sheppard's crook. You can conjure and dismiss the crook as if drawing or sheathing any other weapon. The weapon lasts until you dismiss it, you die, or if you are more than 5 feet from the weapon for longer than 1 minute. The weapon counts quarterstaff and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

You can expend a use of your wild shape to empower your crook after it has been conjured. The crooks's empowerment lasts for 10 minutes. While the crook is empowered, you can add your wisdom modifier to any healing a creature receives from your balm of the summer court feature. Additionally, a creature gains a +1 bonus to their AC while they have temporary hit points from your balm of the summer court feature.

Additionally, you can bind your crook to another magical weapon by performing a special ritual while the weapon and your crook are within 5 feet of you. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. When the ritual completes, the weapon is bound to your crook. While the weapon is bound to your crook, the weapon is absorbed into your crook and the crook gains its magical properties. If the weapon required attunement to benefit from its magical properties, your number of available attunement slots is reduced by 1 while the weapon is bound to the crook.

The bond between your crooks and the weapon breaks if you die, perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or use a another 1-hour ritual. The bound weapon appears at your feet when the bond breaks.
