# Arcane Martialist

You view not just your blade as a weapon, but your mind as well. You have recognized the short comings of purely martial study and taken to the occult to shore up those weaknesses and catch your enemies by surprise. Hours of careful study and memorization have shown you that a target beyond your reach isn't as safe from you as it thinks it is.

## Spellcasting

*3rd-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

### Cantrips

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th and 15th levels.

### Spell Points

You gain a pool of spell points to fuel your arcane capabilities. The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your fighter level, as shown in Spell Points column of the Arcane Martialist Spellcasting table.

Whenever you want to cast a spell, you expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a level equal to the number of spell points expended, and then use that slot to cast the spell. The maximum spell slot level you can create is indicated in the Max Spell Level column of the Arcane Martialist Spellcasting table. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can’t do so. Cantrips don’t require slots and therefore don’t require spell points. You can’t reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Martialist Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can create spell slots for.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level that you can create spell slots for.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Arcane armory

*3rd-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

Instead of keeping your arms on your person, you can stow and retrieve a small number of weapons and ammunition from a extra-dimensional space known as your arcane armory. You can connect a weapon or a piece of ammunition to your arcane armory over the course of one hour as if you were attuning to it (the same hour can both attune you to an item and connect it with your arcane armory).

You can retreive or stow a weapon and up to one piece of ammunition from your arcane armory as part of your action. While you hold an item connected to your arcane armory, it counts as a spellcasting focus for you. If an item connected to your arcane armory is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use a bonus action to immediately and safely teleport the item to your hand.

You can connect a number of items to your arcane armory equal to your proficiency bonus. If you attempt to connect an additional item beyond your maximum to your arcane armory you must disconnect one item currently connected with your arcane armory. Stowing a weapon within your arcane armory cannot break your atunement to it.

## Spellweaving

*7th-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

When you take the attack action on your turn, you can sacrifice any number of attacks to cast a spell of a level equal to the number of sacrificed attacks as part of that attack action. Any attacks you did not sacrifice to cast the spell may be made before or after casting the spell. You may only cast one spell as part of each attack action you take on your turn.

When a creature fails a saving throw from a spell you cast, you have advantage on the next weapon attack that you make against that creature until the end of your next turn. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast until the end of your next turn.

## Warp Strike

*10th-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

You can use your bonus action to teleport yourself up to 60 feet to weapon connected to your arcane armory that is on the same plane of existance as you. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest or by expending 2 spell points.

## Steeled Adaptation

*15th-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

As a bonus action while you are wielding a weapon connected to your arcane armory, you can expend 1 spell point to change the damage type of the weapon for one minute or until you are incapacitated. You can choose to change the weapon's damage type to one of the following: fire, cold, lightning, poison, acid, necrotic, or radiant.

When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon with this feature currently active on it, you can choose to expend 1 spell point to flare the elements ensorcelling the weapon. When you do, the target suffers an additional 3d6 damage of the type you initially chose for the weapon.

## Dominitable

*18th-level Arcane Martialist Feature*

When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell that you cast, you can expend a use of your indominable feature to force the target to reroll the save again at disadvantage. If they fail the saving throw as a result of the reroll forced by this feature, you have advantage on your next saving throw.
