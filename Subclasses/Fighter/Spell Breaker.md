# `=this.file.name`

Typically originating from low-magic societies, spell breakers have trained to fight best against those who choose to wield the weave instead of the blade. They sever the threads of the weave and leave mages cursing their lost spells. While not generally trained in casting spells themselves, spell breakers are familiar with arcane techniques necessary to counter spells and are more proficient in resisting harmful spell effects. Their familiarity with the weave enables them to pull from the power of remnants of magic around them to enhance their own attacks and abilities.  

## Spell Breaker Lore
*3rd-level `=this.file.name` feature*

You learn some early secrets of the arcane as required by those amongst your order. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.

### Spellcasting

Some features of this subclass grant you the ability to cast spells. See Chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the PHB for the wizard spell list which your spells comes from.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for the few spells you know as you have learned them through study of a specific form of martial training. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

Additionally, if the creature fails the saving throw, If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action on its next turn, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.
