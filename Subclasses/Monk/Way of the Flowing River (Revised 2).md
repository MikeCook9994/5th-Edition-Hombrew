# Way of the Flowing River

## Distilled Ki

*3rd level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

When you spend a ki point, you gain 1 youki and 1 inki point.

Your total number of youki and inki points becomes to 0 when you complete a short or long rest.

> Cultural Note\
> The 5th Edition monk's concept of ki is derived from the Japanese word 気 (pronounced "key", romanized "ki"). While it has many meanings, 気 itself refers a creature's spirit in the sense of life energy. This is conceptually identical to the chinese word 氣 (pronounced "chee", romanized "qi"). 陽気 (pronounced "yu-ki", romanized "yuki") and 陰気 (read "in-ki", romanized "inki") are Japanese words that can be used to represent positive and negative energy respectively. 陽気 is composed from the kanji for "positive" and "spirit" (i.e. 気 which was discussed above). While 陰気 is composed from the kanji for "negative" and "spirit". Both words have multiple meanings themselves, but they do also refer to concepts of yin and yang -- 陰気 representing yin and 陽気 representing yang. While this subject is very broad, at its core the philosophy of yin and yang considers the inherit interconnectedness of opposing forces.

## Ebb and Flow

*3rd level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

Through the way of the flowing river, you have learned manipulate ki to lift up your allies and drown out your foes.

### Preparing Ki Manipulations

You prepare a list of ki manipulations available for you to use, choosing from the list of ki manipulations provided at the end of this subclass. When you do so, choose a number of ki manipulations equal to one plus your Wisdom modifier. You always have the *Duality of Water* Ki Manipulation prepared and it does not count against your maximum number of prepared ki manipulations. If a ki manipulation has prerequisites, you must meet them to prepare it. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the Monk class.

You can change your list of prepared ki manipulation when you finish a long rest.

### Utilizing Ki Manipulations

Each ki manipulation's description begins with a block of information that includes the ki manipulation's name, prerequisites (if applicable), and duration. The rest of a ki manipulation entry describes its ebb and flow effects. A ki manipulation's duration follows the same rules used for the duration of spells found in Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook. 

Using a ki manipulation requires an action. When you do so, choose a ki manipulation from your list of prepared ki manipulations. Choose a creature within 5 feet of you as the target of the ki manipulation. You can choose to use the ki manipulation's ebb or flow effect. Using a ki manipulation's ebb or flow effect requires you to spend youki or inki points as described by effect. Some effects may allow you to spend additional inki or youki points to improve the ki manipulation's effect. If a ki manipulation forces the target to make a saving throw, the DC is equal to your ki save DC.

You can effect multiple creatures (but not the same creature more than once) with a ki manipulation in a single turn and you may break up your movement between uses of a ki manipulation. You can only use ebb and flow effects from one ki manipulation. The total number of youki and inki points you spend in a single turn may not exceed your proficiency bonus.

**Duration.** Instantaneous

**_Ebb_.** Expend 1 inki point to attempt to overwhelm the target with negative ki. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saved, the target suffers cold or nectrotic damage (you choose) equal to your martial arts die + your Wisdom modifier, or half damage on a successful save. You can spend additional inki points to deal additional damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die per additional inki point spent.

**_Flow_.** Expend 1 youki point to suffuse the target with a stream of positive ki. The target regains hit points equal to one roll of your martial arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can spend additional youki points to increase the healing done by an amount equal to one roll of your martial arts die per additional youki point spent.
