# Way of the Flowing River

## Distilled Ki

*3rd level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

When you spend a ki point, you gain 1 youki and 1 inki point.

Your total number of youki and inki points becomes to 0 when you complete a short or long rest.

> Cultural Note\
> The 5th Edition monk's concept of ki is derived from the Japanese word 気 (pronounced "key", romanized "ki"). While it has many meanings, 気 itself refers a creature's spirit in the sense of life energy. This is conceptually identical to the chinese word 氣 (pronounced "chee", romanized "qi"). 陽気 (pronounced "yu-ki", romanized "yuki") and 陰気 (read "in-ki", romanized "inki") are Japanese words that can be used to represent positive and negative spirutal energy respectively. 陽気 is composed from the kanji for "positive" and "spirit" (i.e. 気, which was discussed above). While 陰気 is composed from the kanji for "negative" and "spirit". Both words have multiple meanings themselves, but they do also refer to concepts of yin and yang -- 陰気 representing yin and 陽気 representing yang. While this subject is very broad, at its core the philosophy of yin and yang considers the inherit interconnectedness of opposing forces.

## Ebb and Flow

*3rd level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

Through the way of the flowing river, you have learned manipulate ki to lift up your allies and drown out your foes.

### Preparing Ki Manipulations

You prepare a list of ki manipulations available for you to use, choosing from the list of ki manipulations provided at the end of this subclass. When you do so, choose a number of ki manipulations equal to one plus your Wisdom modifier. You always have the *Duality of Water* Ki Manipulation prepared and it does not count against your maximum number of prepared ki manipulations. If a ki manipulation has prerequisites, you must meet them to prepare it. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the Monk class.

You can change your list of prepared ki manipulation when you finish a long rest.

### Using a Ki Manipulations

Each ki manipulation's description begins with a block of information that includes the ki manipulation's name, prerequisites (if applicable), and duration. Each ki manipulation entry defines two possible effects -- an *ebb* and a *flow*. A ki manipulation's *ebb* is a harmful effect that will cost inki points, while its *flow* is a beneficial effect that will cost yuki points. A ki manipulation's duration follows the same rules used for the duration of spells found in Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook. Ki manipulation's can only target a creature within five feet of you.

Using a ki manipulation requires an action. When you do so, choose a ki manipulation from your list of prepared ki manipulations. Then choose the target of the ki manipulation and choose whether you will use the ebb or flow effects. Some effects may allow you to spend additional inki or youki points to improve the ki manipulation's effect. If a ki manipulation forces the target to make a saving throw, the DC is equal to your ki save DC.

When you use your action to perform a ki manipulation, you may use the same ki manipulation multiple times. The total number of youki and inki points you spend in a single turn may not exceed your proficiency bonus. When you use multiple ki manipulations on your turn, you may break up your movement between uses of a ki manipulation.

## To be Determined

*6th level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

Solving the ki point problem should be handled in this feature. Perhaps this should move into the Distilled Ki feature. If so, there should probably be an additional 6th level feature.

1. Not having enough ki points to support the subclass features without sacrificing too much of your core monk capabilities
2. Not being able to access subclass features because you need to first spend ki points.
   1. While silly, being able to freely distill ki is important. A bonus action that allows you to distill ki at twice effectiveness would be compelling I think.

## Ki Manipulations

### Duality of Water

**Duration.** Instantaneous

**_Ebb_.** Expend 1 inki point to attempt to overwhelm the target with negative ki. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saved, the target suffers cold or nectrotic damage (you choose) equal to your martial arts die + your Wisdom modifier, or half damage on a successful save. You can spend additional inki points to deal additional damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die per additional inki point spent.

**_Flow_.** Expend 1 youki point to suffuse the target with a stream of positive ki. The target regains hit points equal to one roll of your martial arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can spend additional youki points to increase the healing done by an amount equal to one roll of your martial arts die per additional youki point spent.
