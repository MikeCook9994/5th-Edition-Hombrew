# Way of the Flowing River

Monks of the Way of the Flowing River have mastered the art of manipulating the flow of ki throughout the body. Years of study and meditation have allowed them to see how ki moves within creatures both friend and foe. Within their monasteries, these monks typically serve as healers who can aid those in need by repairing or strengthening the flow of their ki. Many amongst them are also practiced fighters whose precision strikes harm and debilitate their enemies.

## Ebb and Flow

*3rd-Level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

you can expend your ki to manipulate the ki of your friends and foes. Your touch can purify and strengthen the flow of your allys’ ki to bolster and heal them; similarly, your attacks can diminish the flow and taint the ki of your enemies.

You know Healing Touch, Corrupting Strike, and one additional ki manipulation of your choice which are detailed in the “Ki Manipulations” section below. You learn two additional ki manipulations of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Additionally, you know the guidance and resolve cantrips.

In addition to your known ki manipulations, when you complete a long rest, you can prepare a list of ki manipulations available to you. When you do so, choose a number of ki manipulations equal to your proficiency bonus. Preparing a new list of ki manipulations requires meditation, 1 minute per ki point of the ki manipulation’s base ki cost. 

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can also replace one ki manipulation that you have learned with a different manipulation.

### Casting Spells 

Most ki manipulations allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules. However, all spells cast via a ki manipulation have a range of touch and any spell that requires a ranged spell attack instead requires a melee spell attack. Additionally, spells cast via ki manipulations do not require material components unless the ki manipulation’s description specifies otherwise.  

At 5th level, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a ki manipulation spell that you cast, provided the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as cure wounds does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 7th level monk and use the healing touch ki manipulation to cast Cure Wounds, you can spend 2 ki points to cast it as a 2nd level spell (the manipulation’s base cost of 1 ki point plus 1 ki point per additional level).

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cast and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spell and Ki Points table.

**Spells and Ki Points**

| Monk Level | Maximum Ki Points for a Spell |
|---|---|
| 5th-8th | 2 |
| 9th-12th | 3 |
| 13th-16th | 4 |
| 17th-20th | 5 |

## Eroding Shores

*3rd-Level Way of the Flowing River Feature*

your understanding of the flow of ki throughout the body enables you to precisely strike targets at their pressure points to disrupt the flow of their ki. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, the target’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. Further hits you make against the target on your turn increase this penalty by an additional 5 feet. Failing to hit the target with an attack prevents the target from suffering any additional penalties as a result of this feature until the beginning of your next turn. 

At 6th level, if you successfully hit a target with two consecutive attacks with unarmed strikes or monk weapons in a single turn, the target has a -1 penalty to attack rolls until the end of their next turn. Further hits you make against the target on your turn increase this penalty by -1, up to a maximum of -3. 

At 11th level, if you successfully hit a target with three consecutive attacks with unarmed strikes or monk weapons in a single turn, the target has a -1 penalty to its AC and a -1 penalty to their saving throws until the end of its next turn. Further hits you make against the target on your turn increase the penalty of both of these effects by -1, up to a maximum of -3.

At 17th level, if you successfully hit a target with four consecutive unarmed strikes in a single turn, the target is stunned until end of their next turn.
