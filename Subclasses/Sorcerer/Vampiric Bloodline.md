# Vampiric Bloodline

The dark powers you command comes from the vampiric curse that courses through your veins. Some may trace the origins of this curse back through their ancestry. Though some may have been left with this mark after a close brush with a vampire themselves. Regardless of how this curse came to you, the more you choose to embrace its dark powers, the more difficult it becomes to resist the whispers that gnaw at the back of your mind.

## Vampiric Bloodline Spells

*1st-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

You learn additional spells when you reach Certain levels in this class, as shown on the Vampiric Spells table. Each of these spells count as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 1st | Charm Person, Inflict Wounds |
| 3rd | Misty Step, Pass Without Trace |
| 5th | Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch |
| 7th | Blight, Faithful Hound |
| 9th | Dominate Person, Dream |

Additionally, you learn the *Chill Touch* cantrip and it does not count against the number of cantrips you know.

## Unyielding Thirst

*1st-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

Your vampiric curse compels you to feed on the life force of the living. When you a complete a long rest and have not dealt necrotic damage to a living creature other than yourself in 72 hours or more, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you must move towards the closest living creature and deal necrotic damage to it. Your compulsion wanes once you deal this damage. 

Any time you deal necrotic damage to a living creature, choose one of the damage dice and heal for that amount. You cannot heal for more than target’s total hit points.

## Inescapable Darkness

*6th-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

The might of your dark power is irresistible. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, any damage you deal ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

## Fly By Night

*14th-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

You night cannot stop your hunt. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120ft.

Additionally, as an action, you can polymorph into a Bat. While in this form, your game statistics are replaced by that of a bat; however, you maintain your Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom scores. You change back into your true form if you are reduced to 0 hit points or if you dismiss it as an action.


## Vampiric Form

*14th-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

Your deepened connection with your sinister ancestry enables you to assume a vampiric form for a period of time. As a bonus action, you can enter this form for one minute. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, or you die.

While in your vampiric form you gain the following effects:

* You can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
* You regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sorcerer level at the start of your turn.
* Damage you deal treats immunity to necrotic damage as resistance to necrotic damage.
* You can cast Command as a 1st level spell without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell using this feature, the spell can affect undead and the target can understand the command even if it does not know your language.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it against until you complete a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

## Misty Escape

*18th-Level Vampiric Bloodline Feature*

When you drop to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead and turn into a cloud of mist. While in this form you are immune to all damage and conditions, but cannot take any action other than the dash action. You return to your true form after being healed above 1 hit point. If you remain at 1 hit point while in your mist for one hour, you fall to 0 hit points.

Once you enter your mist form, you cannot enter it again until you complete a long rest.
