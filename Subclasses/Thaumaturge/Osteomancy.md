# Osteomancy

You rely on your understanding of the energies that suffuse common objects connected to the threads that compose the infinite everything that is the Tapestry. Your awareness of awaiting fates helps you navigate the complexities of the immediate reality. When you cast spells, you apply the information bestowed to you by your osteomancy set to help manifest the outcomes they described.

## Casting Bones
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

You carry an osteomancy set composed of objects connected to you or the natural world such as small animal bones, seashells, a trinket from a late parent, and more. The maximum number of items you can have in your osteomancy set at any time is equal to your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Your Osteomancy set can be used as a spellcasting focus for your thaumaturge spells.

You can add an item to your osteomancy set by performing a ritual lasting 10 minutes that cleanses the item and illuminates how the item is connected to the Tapestry. When you complete this ritual, choose a meaning from the "Osteomancy Set Item Meanings" table below to assign to it. You may conduct this ritual on an item already in your osteomancy set to choose a new meaning for it. No more than three items in your osteomancy set may have the same meaning at any time. You may remove an item from your osteomancy set at any time. 

**Osteomancy Set Item Meanings**

| Meaning | Casting Die |
|---|---|
| protection | d4 |
| movement | d6 |
| life | d8 |
| suffering | d10 |
| Knowledge | d12 |
| fate | d20 |

When you complete a long rest, you may cast the bones in your osteomancy set. To do so, choose a number of items in your osteomancy set equal to your Proficiency Bonus and roll the casting die associated with the meaning of each chosen items. Record the meanings and the results of their associated casting die rolls. When you do this, discard any casting die result rolls recorded from when you have previously cast your bones.

## Foretold Outcomes
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

When you cast a thaumaturge spell using a spell slot, you can pull on the threads of the Tapestry to aide in the manifestation the outcomes foretold by the bones you cast. You can choose one of the die rolls recorded when you cast your bones and gain an effect based on the meaning affiliated with the bone that was cast. Once you have chosen a particular result, it cannot be chosen again.

  **protection.** The target of the spell's armor class increases by the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones until the start of their next turn. This effect can stack with other spells that increase armor class, but only the greatest active instance of this effect may be considered at a time.

  **movement.** Immediately after casting the spell, you may move up to a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones. This movement does provoke opportunity attacks.

  **life.** You or the target of the spell regains hit points equal to the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones.

  **suffering.** The target of the spell suffers force damage equal to the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones.

  **knowledge.** The target of the triggering spell may add the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones to the one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check that they make within the next minute that they are not already proficient in.

  **fate.** You may replace a d20 roll made as a result of the spell's casting (e.g. an attack roll or saving throw) with the result of the number rolled on the die when you cast your bones.
