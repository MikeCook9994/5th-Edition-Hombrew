# Osteomancy

You rely on your understanding of the energies that suffuse common objects connected to the threads that compose the infinite everything that is the Tapestry. Your awareness of awaiting fates helps you navigate the complexities of the immediate reality. When you cast spells, you apply the information bestowed to you by your osteomancy set to help manifest the outcomes they described.

## Osteomancer's Foci
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

You have an osteomancy set that is composed of objects connected to you or the natural world. Examples of suitable items are animal bones, seashells, or a small trinket from a late parent or ancestor. The maximum number of items you can have in your osteomancy set at any time is equal to your Thaumaturge Level + your Intelligence modifier. Your Osteomancy set can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Thaumaturge spells.

You can add an item to your osteomancy set by performing a ritual lasting 10 minutes that cleanses the item and opens your mind to how the item is connected to the Tapestry. When you complete this ritual, choose a meaning from the "Osteomancy Set Item Meanings" table below to assign to it. You may conduct this ritual on an item already in your osteomancy set to choose a new meaning for it; however, no more than three items in your osteomancy set may have the same meaning at any time. You may remove an item from your osteomancy set at any time. Maintain a record of all of the items in your osteomancy set with the meanings you chose for them.

## Casting the Bones
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

When you complete a long rest, you cast the bones in your osteomancy set. To do so, roll the casting die associated with the meaning you previously chose for each of the items in your osteomancy set, according to the "Osteomancy Set Item Meanings" table. Record the result of the casting die roll alongside the records of your osteomancy set items and their meanings. When you do this, discard the results of any casting die rolls from previous uses of this feature.

>**Osteomancy for Dice Goblins**\

>These rules are written to assume that you own no more than a singular die of each side count (d4, d6, d12, etc...). However, with a sufficiently large dice collection, you may choose a specific die in your collection to persistently be used as the Casting Die for a particular item in your character's osteomancy set. The chosen die must match the Casting Die associated with the item's chosen meaning according to the "Osteomancy Set Item Meanings" table and be visually distinct from all other dice that have been chosen as persistent Casting Dice.\
>\
>If you choose to do this, it is important to amend your osteomancy set record for each item to include include a sufficient visual description of the persistent Casting Die. Whenever you use your Casting the Bones feature, you can roll all of the persistent Casting Dice at once, then record the result of each casting die roll with the item it represents.

## Bone Casting Spellcraft
*1st-level Osteomancy Feature*

When you cast a thaumaturge spell using a spell slot, choose one of the items in your osteomancy set and enact the effect associated with its meaning that is described below. Once you have chosen to use an item from your osteomancy set with this feature, you may not select it again until you cast your bones again following a long rest.

  **protection.** The target of the spell's armor class increases by the casting die's result until the start of their next turn.

  **Certainty.** Add the casting die's result to your next attack roll.

  **Failure.** Subtract the casting die's result from the next saving throw made in response to a spell you cast.

  **movement.** Immediately after casting the spell, you may move up to a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the casting die. This movement does provoke opportunity attacks.

  **life.** You or the target of the spell regains hit points equal the casting die's result.

  **suffering.** The target of the spell suffers force damage equal the casting die's result.

## Fate Reader
*6th-level Osteomancy Feature*
